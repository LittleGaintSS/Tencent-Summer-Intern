# 2021 Tencent-Summer-Intern (Code)
I will try to update the code with translated version soon.  Here are daily codes that I use during my intern. 

This helps the team to simplify the process of updating data and to improve the effiency of work. 

During the intern, I mainly use pandas, numpy, openpyxl and matplotlib modules.

**Python** is indeed useful!

P.S. The daily data cannot be uploaded into Github due to restriction of the company.
